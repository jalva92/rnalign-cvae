# cVAE Gene Expression Repository

This repository provides a modular, extensible implementation of a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) for gene expression data analysis. It is designed for reproducible research, easy experimentation, and extensibility to new datasets and tasks.

## Features

- Modular codebase with clear separation of models, data, training, and utilities
- YAML-based configuration system for reproducible experiments
- Command-line scripts for training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Example scripts and Jupyter notebooks for common workflows
- Comprehensive documentation and API reference

## Directory Structure

- `cvae/` - Core package (models, data, training, utils)
- `scripts/` - Command-line scripts for training, evaluation, and tuning
- `configs/` - Configuration files (default and experiment-specific)
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `docs/` - Documentation and API reference
- `examples/` - Example scripts for common use cases
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
